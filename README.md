emacs-conf ==========

My emacs configuration.

The basic structure is as follows:

- an emacs-conf/ directory, containing

  - a .emacs file, to be copied wherever emacs is going to look for a
    config file (by default ~/), and to be altered so that it points
    to the actual location of the emacs-conf/ dir on the file
    system. Everything else is going to happen in emacs-conf/emacs.d/

  - an emacs.d/ directory, containing

    - an init.el file, with the basic emacs configuration and which
      loads everything found in the elisp/ dir

    - an elisp/ dir, containing all other plugins, modules and
      dependencies

    - a backups/ dir, where all backup files generated by emacs are
      centralized (not under version control)

TODO:
 - organize the elisp dir (theme-oriented dirs)
 - fix the customize conf, find nice portable theme & font
 - fix the ruby-mode-expansions.el dependency issue
 - install JDEE
 - configure gnus
 - emacs 24 : gestion des d√©pendances avec ELPA
