;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs has that pretty minor mode for highlighting current line:
;; `hl-line-mode', not many people use it all the time, but it's worth
;; enabling in many types of buffers that deal with lists of items, one item
;; per line. This packages allows to enable it everywhere for readability.

;;; Code:

(defvar highlight-line-target-modes
  '(Buffer-menu-mode
    bookmark-bmenu-mode
    dired-mode
    dired-by-name-mode
    gnus-group-mode
    gnus-summary-mode
    ibuffer-mode
    package-menu-mode)
  "List of modes that are affected by `highlight-line-mode'.")

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode highlight-line-mode
  "Toggle highlight-line-mode minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable highlight-line if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or NIL, and toggle it if ARG is
`toggle'.
This minor mode is global. When it's active the following major
modes activate `hl-line-mode' automatically:
* buffer menu mode
* bookmark menu mode
* Dired mode
* GNUS group mode
* GNUS summary mode
* IBuffer mode
* package menu mode"
  :global t
  (dolist (mode highlight-line-target-modes)
    (funcall
     (if highlight-line-mode
         #'add-hook
       #'remove-hook)
     (intern (concat (symbol-name mode) "-hook"))
     #'hl-line-mode)))

(provide 'highlight-line)
